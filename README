-------------------------------------------------------------

nfct_snatlog is a command line tool to logging SNAT translations using 
netfilter connection tracking library. It gives the following information about
a source NAT connection:
 - Original L3 address (IP)
 - Original L4 address (TCP/UDP Port)
 - Translated L3 address (IP)
 - Translated L4 address (TCP/UDP Port)
 - Duration of the connection

This kind of information is very useful to identify hosts of the intranet that
generate a security incident.
